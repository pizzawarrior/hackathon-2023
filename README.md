### About:
The concept for this project is a web-app for global surfing enthusiasts to use. Users can access the site and click on images of 6 of the top big-wave surfing destinations of the world. Using the Open Weather API, the page pulls in weather data, and based on the favorability of the condisions displays a random image (from the Pexels API,) of 'happy,' :smiley: if the conditions are favorable, or 'sad,' :cry: if the conditions are not.

### Criteria

- Time Limit: 2.5 hrs to conceptualize, build, test, and present
