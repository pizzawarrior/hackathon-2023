## :fire: Is It Firing? :fire:

The concept for this project is a web-app for global surfing enthusiasts to use. Users can access the site and click on images of 6 of the top big-wave surfing destinations of the world. Using the Open Weather API, the page pulls in weather data, and based on the favorability of the conditions displays a random image (from the Pexels API,) of 'happy,' :smiley: if the conditions are favorable, or 'sad,' :cry: if the conditions are not. 

This project is the product of a Hackathon in the Hack Reactor full-stack web development bootcamp in the summer of 2023. 

The criteria was to build a React project using 2 different API's to pull in data, and we had 2.5 hrs to conceptualize, build, test, and present it. Our team consisted of 2 people: myself, and @spiderthatcodes.

Big Wave Spots Include:
* Nazare, Portugal
* Cloudbreak, Fiji
* Mavericks, California
* Pipeline, Hawaii
* Puerto Escondido, Mexico
* Tehapo'o, Tahiti
