The concept for this project is a web-app for people in the surf industry to use. Users can access the site and click on images of 6 of the top big-wave surfing destinations of the world. Using the Open Weather API, the page pulls in weather data, and based on the favorability of the condisions displays an image (from the Pexels API,) of 'happy,' if the conditions are favorable, or 'sad,' if they are not. 

This project is the product of a Hackathon in the Hack Reactor full-stack web development bootcamp in the summer of 2023. 

The criteria was to build a React project using 2 different API's to pull in data, and we had 2.5 hrs to conceptualize, build, test, and present it. Our team consisted of 2 people: myself, and @spidergrrljess.
